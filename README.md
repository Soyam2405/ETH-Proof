# ETH-Proof Assessment - Getting Started with Solidity
I will be sharing my learnings of this lesson with the help of fun project assigned by metacrafters team.
## Description
This Solidity contract named soyamToken represents a token called Solana (Sol) with an initial total supply of 0 tokens. It allows for minting new tokens to a specified address and burning tokens from a given address, ensuring token balance integrity.
### Code execution
For executing the code i have used remix ide [https://remix.ethereum.org/].

### Code Explanation
This Solidity code defines a contract for a token called "Solana" with the abbreviation "Sol". It has a total supply of 0 tokens and includes functions to mint (create) new tokens and burn (destroy) existing ones. The tokenbalances mapping keeps track of token balances for each address.

#### Execution steps on remix ide online
1. Click on compile.

2. Must ensure the compiler version set to according to program and click on file_name.sol .

3. Now go to deploy and transact section and click on transact after selecting the account.
